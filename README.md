# RFM-Based Customer Segmentation and Early-Risk Prediction
![Research](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Research-blue)

This repository presents a data-driven framework for customer segmentation and early-risk prediction using transactional data. The work integrates RFM-based behavioral segmentation, temporal trend analysis, and supervised learning to identify early warning signs of customer disengagement.

This project supports an academic research paper currently under preparation.

## 📌 Problem Overview
Customer churn prediction is often treated as a black-box classification task. This work proposes an interpretable framework that combines customer value segmentation with early behavioral decline detection, enabling proactive risk identification before complete churn occurs.

---

## 🧠 Methodology
- RFM feature engineering (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- K-Means clustering for customer segmentation
- Temporal behavioral trend analysis
- Early-risk labeling based on behavioral deterioration
- Supervised learning stage for early-risk prediction

---

## 📊 Results
- Clear separation of customer value segments
- Early decline detection among high-value customers
- Stable predictive performance (ROC-AUC ≈ 0.79)
- Feature analysis highlights frequency and monetary value as dominant predictors

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Details
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Dataset is not included due to privacy constraints
- The notebook focuses on reproducible methodology and evaluation

---

## 📄 Paper Status
The research paper based on this work is being prepared and may be submitted to an academic conference or journal.
